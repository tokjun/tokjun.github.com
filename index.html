        <h3>About Me</h3>

<p>Junichi is an Instructor in Radiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. He received a B.S. in Engineering in 2002, an M.S. in Information Science and Technology in 2004, and a Ph.D. in Information Science and Technology in 2007, from the University of Tokyo, Japan. His research interests include navigation software, MRI-compatible robots, and integration of these technologies for the operating room. He has been working on these topics since 2001, and has broad experience developing software and devices for these applications. For example, software that he developed at the Shiga University of Medical Science, Japan, to assist in MRI-guided microwave coagulation therapy of liver tumors, has already been used in more than 100 clinical cases. He joined the Image-Guided Therapy Program at Brigham and Women's Hospital in April 2007, and continues to work on MR-guided therapy.</p>
